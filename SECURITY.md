## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find or notice any security vulnerability in Fensak software, you can report the finding to the team at:

    security@fensak.io

We will review the potential threat and work towards issuing a fix based on the level of risk associated with the
vulnerability. During this time, we may follow up with additional information or guidance. Once a proper assessment has
been made, we will provide a detailed response indicating the next steps in handling your report, and endeavor to keep
you infomred of the progress towards a fix and full announcement.

Thank you for your help in improving the security of our open source software. We appreciate your efforts and
responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.
